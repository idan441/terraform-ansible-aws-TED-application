HERE WILL BE THE SHH KEY TO LOGIN TO THE INSTANCES. 
YOU SHOULD REPLACE THIS FILE WITH YOU KEY FILE! 

Ansible will use this key to connect to the instances and to play the playbook. (=doing the command over the EC2 instances.) 
The key is generated through the AWS console. 

MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE KEY SECRET - AS IF SOMEONE WILL STEAL IT - HE WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIGURE THE INSTANCES! EVEN WORSE - YOU WILL BE THE ONE PAYING FOR IT! 


Also make sure the key file premission is set to 400 , as the SSH command in Linux requires the key to have this premission in order for it to use it. ( type chmod 400 terra.pem to set the key. )
